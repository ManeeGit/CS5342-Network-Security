Computer Network Security
• Definition: The protection afforded to an automated information 
system in order to attain the application objectives to preserving the 
integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system 
resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, 
and telecommunications).  
- NIST Computer Security Handbook

Confidentiality
• Data confidentiality: Assures that private or confidential information 
is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals; 
• Privacy: Assures that individual's control or influence what 
information related to them may be collected and stored and by 
whom and to whom that information may be disclosed
• i.e., student grade information


## Page 6

Integrity
• Data integrity: Assures that data (both stored and in transmitted 
packets) and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized
manner;
• System integrity: Assures that a system performs its intended 
function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or 
inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system
• i.e., a hospital patient’s allergy information  
• i.e., Multi-head attention mechanism, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/multi-head-
attention-mechanism/

Availability
• Availability: Assures that systems work promptly, and service is not 
denied to authorized users, ensuring timely and reliable access to and 
use of information
• i.e., denial of service attack

Other security requirements
• Authenticity
• Accountability
• tracible data source, 
• fault isolation
• intrusion detection and prevention, 
• recovery and legal action
• system must keep records of their activities to permit later forensic analysis to 
trace security breaches or to aid in transaction disputes
