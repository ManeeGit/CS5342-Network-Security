indications as to how to proceed on to the next step as well as the grade until that point. 
The project can be attempted in three ways: 1. Without seeking any sort of help 2. Using 
some provided hints 3. Using exact directions The IRC includes the files needed for this 
project: 1. Web Security project 2. Web Hacking exercises (XSS and Script-attacks) 
covering client-side and server-side vulnerability exploitations, respectively 3. 
Documentation for installation and use for the above 4. A PowerPoint file describing Web 
hacking. This file is crucial to understanding how to use the exercises since it clearly 
explains the operation using screen shots. This project was designed and implemented by 
Professor Sreekanth Malladi of Dakota State University. B.3 Programming Projects The 
programming project is a useful pedagogical tool. There are several attractive features of 
stand-alone programming projects that are not part of an existing security facility. 1. The 
instructor can choose from a wide variety of cryptography and network security concepts 
to assign projects. 2. The projects can be programmed by the students on any available 
computer and in any appropriate language; they are platform and language independent. 
3. The instructor need not download, install, and configure any particular infrastructure for 
stand-alone projects. 440 Appendix B / Projects for Teaching Network Security There is 
also flexibility in the size of projects. Larger projects give students more sense of 
achievement, but students with less ability or fewer organizational skills can be left 
behind. Larger projects usually elicit more overall effort from the best students. Smaller 
projects can have a higher concepts-to-code ratio, and because more of them can be 
assigned, the opportunity exists to address a variety of different areas. Again, as with 
research projects, the students should first submit a proposal. The student handout 
should include the same elements listed in Section B.1. The IRC includes a set of twelve 
possible programming projects. The following individuals have supplied the research and 
programming projects suggested in the instructor’s manual: Henning Schulzrinne of 
Columbia University; Cetin Kaya Koc of Oregon State University; and David M. Balenson of 
Trusted Information Systems and George Washington University. B.4 Laboratory Exercises 
Professor Sanjay Rao and Ruben Torres of Purdue University have prepared a set of 
laboratory exercises that are part of the IRC. These are implementation projects designed 
to be programmed on Linux but could be adapted for any Unix environment. These 
laboratory exercises provide realistic experience in implementing security functions and 
applications. B.5 Practical Security Assessments Examining the current infrastructure and 
practices of an existing organization is one of the best ways of developing skills in 
assessing its security posture. The IRC contains a list of such activities. Students, working 
either individually or in small groups, select a suitable small-to-medium-sized 
organization. They then interview some key personnel in that organization in order to 
conduct a suitable selection of security risk assessment and review tasks as it relates to 
the organization’s IT infrastructure and practices. As a result, they can then recommend 
suitable changes, which can improve the organization’s IT security. These activities help 
students develop an appreciation of current security practices and the skills needed to 
review these and recommend changes. Lawrie Brown of the Australian Defence Force 
Academy developed these projects. B.6 Firewall Projects The implementation of network 
firewalls can be a difficult concept for students to grasp initially. The IRC includes a 
Network Firewall Visualization tool to convey and teach network security and firewall 
configuration. This tool is intended to teach and reinforce key concepts including the use 
and purpose of a perimeter firewall, the use of separated subnets, the purposes behind 
packet filtering, and the shortcomings of a simple packet filter firewall. B.9 / 
Reading/Report Assignments 441 The IRC includes a .jar file that is fully portable and a

series of exercises. The tool and exercises were developed at U.S. Air Force Academy. B.7 
Case Studies Teaching with case studies engages students in active learning. The IRC 
includes case studies in the following areas: ■■ Disaster recovery ■■ Firewalls ■■ 
Incidence response ■■ Physical security ■■ Risk ■■ Security policy ■■ Virtualization Each 
case study includes learning objectives, case description, and a series of case discussion 
questions. Each case study is based on real-world situations and includes papers or 
reports describing the case. The case studies were developed at North Carolina A&T State 
University. B.8 Writing Assignments Writing assignments can have a powerful multiplier 
effect in the learning process in a technical discipline such as cryptography and network 
security. Adherents of the Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) movement 
(http://wac.colostate.edu/) report substantial benefits of writing assignments in 
facilitating learning. Writing assignments lead to more detailed and complete thinking 
about a particular topic. In addition, writing assignments help to overcome the tendency of 
students to pursue a subject with a minimum of personal engagement—just learning facts 
and problemsolving techniques without obtaining a deep understanding of the subject 
matter. The IRC contains a number of suggested writing assignments, organized by 
chapter. Instructors may ultimately find that this is an important part of their approach to 
teaching the material. I would greatly appreciate any feedback on this area and any 
suggestions for additional writing assignments. B.9 Reading/Report Assignments Another 
excellent way to reinforce concepts from the course and to give students research 
experience is to assign papers from the literature to be read and analyzed. The IRC 
includes a suggested list of papers, one or two per chapter, to be assigned. A PDF copy of 
each of the papers is available at https://app.box.com/netsec6e. The IRC also includes a 
suggested assignment wording. 442 References Abbreviations ACM Association for
